<h6>Additional: </h6>
I used this in most of my projects before i was aware of frameworks to make my life easy of db stuff. Now, some of my friends still use it and i still use it too from time to time and i also add or update functions in it to help my friends or improve the security or speed of the projects which are still using it. It might not be the best but it helped me a lot to speed my development.

<h6>P.S.</h6>
Also, if you think it can be improved. Feel free to commit changes and let me know!
